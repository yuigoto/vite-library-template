# Vite Library Template

> A template for JavaScript/TypeScript library projects using Vite as a bundler.

---

## Dependencies

- `typescript` **`^4.5.x`**

---

## How to

Place your library code under the `lib` folder and expose it through its `index.ts` file.

This project was bootstrapped using `yarn create vite`, so you can use its commands to execute/build the project:

- `yarn dev`: executes the project locally, you can use test-specific code on `src` and import directly from `lib`;
- `yarn build`: builds and bundles your project, also generates definition files for your coding completion pleasure;
- `yarn preview`: not used really, since it's mostly for previewing the production build locally;
